        <h3>How to make peri peri sauce</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We start by roasting the peppers and red onion with oil, paprika,
            smoked paprika, cayenne and salt. Then add the garlic and chillies
            and roast for a further 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            We then transfer this smoky-roasted goodness to a blender, along
            with dried Bird's eye chillies, white pepper, lemon zest and juice
            and dried rosemary and blend it all up to form a thick paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then add oil and some red wine vinegar and blend again to a lovely
            thick, spoon-able consistency. If you want it thinner, simply thin
            it out with more oil, or you can stir in some cold water.

        <h3>How to spatchcock a chicken</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place the chicken breast-side down on a sturdy chopping board, with
            the legs towards you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using heavy-duty scissors or poultry shears, cut along both sides of
            the backbone. It's a little fiddly, as you have to cut through each of
            the rib bones as you go. So it's better to go slowly, rather than
            trying to cut through multiple ribs at once.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you've cut through both sides of the backbone, discard the bone
            (or save it to make stock). Turn the chicken over and press down with
            both hands on the breast bone to flatten the chicken.
          </li>

        <h3>How to cook the chicken</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place the chicken on a baking tray and smother with a few tablespoons
            of Peri Peri sauce. Bake for 45 minutes
          </li>
          <li>
            Then baste the chicken and spoon on a little more sauce. Finish off
            the chicken in the oven for another 10-15 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will come out of the oven a deep dark red. Leave it to rest for 10
            minutes to ensure it's extra juicy
